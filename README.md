This repository contains five files, each addressing different programming challenges and patterns. Here's a brief overview of each file:

## 1.c - Debugging Merge Sort
This file focuses on debugging the Merge Sort algorithm. It is essential for understanding and correcting issues in the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C.

## 2.c - Debugging Selection Sort
Similar to the first file, this one is dedicated to debugging the Selection Sort algorithm. Debugging is crucial for ensuring the correct functioning of sorting algorithms.

## 3.py - Case Study in Python
This Python file presents a case study involving employees in the accounts department. The task is to determine the salary of the person who survives, considering the removal of the employee with the highest and lowest salaries during a crisis.

### Input:
- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each subsequent line consists of three distinct positive integers representing the salaries of three employees.

### Output:
- For each test case, the output is a single line containing the salary of the surviving employee after removing the one with the highest and lowest salaries.

## 4.c - Right Half Pyramid Pattern in C
This C file focuses on generating a right half pyramid pattern. Understanding and implementing different patterns are essential skills in programming.

## 5.c - Full Pyramid Pattern in C
Similar to the previous file, this C program generates a full pyramid pattern. It provides practice in designing and implementing patterns in the C programming language.

Feel free to explore and use these files for learning and reference purposes. If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements, please feel free to contribute to this repository.

Happy coding!
